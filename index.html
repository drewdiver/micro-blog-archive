<blockquote>
<p>Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive the only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence—that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.</p>

         	<p><strong>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780375705106">The Way of Zen</a> by Alan Watts 📚</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a concise <em>history</em> of sorts in this book about Zen Buddhism and its evolution from Taoism and Confucianism as well as the roots of it from India.</p>

<p>However, I basically ended up skipping most of the first section. The meat of this book resides under “Part Two: Principles and Practice,&rdquo; particularly sections (or chapters) 1 &amp; 2 titled “Empty and Marvelous&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sitting. Quietly, Doing Nothing” respectively.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>

<p>Presence! This is something that definitely awakens once you have a kid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, the measuring of worth and success in terms of time, and the insistent demand for assurances of a future, make it impossible to live freely both in the promising present and in the &ldquo;promising&rdquo; future when it arrives. For there is never anything but the present, and if one cannot live there, one can- not live anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this idea of not clinging to the past, not dwelling on the future (you&rsquo;ll never know it) but to keep moving&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The identification of the mind with its own image is, therefore, paralyzing because the image is fixed-it is past and finished. But it is a fixed image of oneself in motion! To cling to it is thus to be in constant contradiction and conflict. Hence Yün-men&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;In walking, just walk. In sitting, just sit. Above all, don&rsquo;t wobble.&rdquo; In other words, the mind cannot act without giving up the impossible attempt to control itself beyond a certain point. It must let go of itself both in the sense of trusting its own memory and reflection, and in the sense of acting spontaneously, on its own into the unknown.</p>

<p>This is why Zen often seems to take the side of action as against reflection, and why it describes itself as &ldquo;no-mind&rdquo; (wu-hsin) or &ldquo;no-thought&rdquo; (wu-nien), and why the masters demonstrate Zen by giving instantaneous and unpremeditated answers to questions. When Yün-men was asked for the ultimate secret of Buddhism, he replied, &ldquo;Dumpling!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In regards to meditation, the West often has a hard time to just sit. It&rsquo;s seen as a &ldquo;waste of time.” We can also see in other religions<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Christianity-for-instance"><a href="#fn:Christianity-for-instance">0</a></sup> that it is to always just be <em>in action</em>. However we should stop and consider…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…it should be obvious that action without wisdom, without clear awareness of the world as it really is, can never improve anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each of the other senses might similarly be used to illustrate the &ldquo;non-active&rdquo; functioning of the mind-listening without straining to hear, smelling without strong inhalation, tasting without screwing up the tongue, and touching without pressing the object. Each is a special instance of the mental function which works through all, and which Chinese designates with the peculiar word <strong>hsin</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This term is so important for the understanding of Zen that some attempt must be made to say what Taoism and Chinese thought in general take it to mean.&rsquo; We usually translate it as &ldquo;mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;heart,&rdquo; but neither of these words is satisfactory. The original form of the ideograph seems to be a picture of the heart, or perhaps of the lungs or the liver, and when a Chinese speaks of the <strong>hsin</strong> he will often point to the center of his chest, slightly lower than the heart.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>While reading <a href="https://theoverspill.blog">The Overspill</a> this morning I came across the following post:</p>

<p><a href="https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/">Why the iPhone Timer App displays a Fake Time</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>TL;DR
The iPhone countdown timer doesn’t strictly display the correct time but adds 500ms, or half a second, to the remaining time. It does this to make the reading of time more intuitive for humans. The alarm at the end of the countdown is not affected by this 500ms inaccuracy.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I became a bit giddy as I recently finished <a href="https://jaronlanier.com">Jaron Lanier&rsquo;s</a> book<a href="http://jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html"> <em>You Are Not A Gadget</em></a> at the end of 2019 which sort of makes sense of the above issue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There’s a core design feature in UNIX called a “command line interface.” In this system, you type instructions, you hit “return,” and the instructions are carried out.* A unifying design principle of UNIX is that a program can’t tell if a person hit return or a program did so. Since real people are slower than simulated people at operating keyboards, the importance of precise timing is suppressed by this particular idea. As a result, UNIX is based on discrete events that don’t have to happen at a precise moment in time. The human organism, meanwhile, is based on continuous sensory, cognitive, and motor processes that have to be synchronized precisely in time..</em></p>

<p><em>The arguments in favor of UNIX focused on how computers would get literally millions of times faster in the coming decades. The thinking was that the speed increase would overwhelm the timing problems I was worried about. Indeed, today’s computers are millions of times faster, and UNIX has become an ambient part of life. There are some reasonably expressive tools that have UNIX in them, so the speed increase has sufficed to compensate for UNIX’s problems in some cases. But not all.</em></p>

<p><em>I have an iPhone in my pocket, and sure enough, the thing has what is essentially UNIX in it. An unnerving element of this gadget is that it is haunted by a weird set of unpredictable user interface delays. One’s mind waits for the response to the press of a virtual button, but it doesn’t come for a while. An odd tension builds during that moment, and easy intuition is replaced by nervousness. It is the ghost of UNIX, still refusing to accommodate the rhythms of my body and my mind, after all these years.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note, he states he&rsquo;s not just picking on the iPhone or UNIX, Windows is guilty as well.</p>
